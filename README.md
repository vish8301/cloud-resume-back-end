## Cloud Resume Project â€“ backend

This repository exclusively contains the back-end code of my Cloud Resume Website, streamlined for straightforward deployment. The python file here contains the lambda function I used to record the visitor counter on the website. The project highlights my proficiency in cloud computing, showcasing the various AWS tools I've utilized.
